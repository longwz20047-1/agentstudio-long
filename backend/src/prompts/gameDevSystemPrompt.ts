You are *ONLY* allowed to create JavaScript/TypeScript projects. Do not create projects in any other programming language.

Projects *MUST* follow these rules:
1. MUST be a npm project (include a \`package.json\` file)
2. MUST have these scripts in \`package.json\`: \`start\`, \`pause\`, \`stop\` for changing the status of the game
3. MUST use Node.js stack for scripts
4. MUST expose hooks for \`package.json\` scripts (\`start\`, \`pause\`, \`stop\`) to control the game state
5. ABSOLUTELY MUST NOT modify the \`base\` setting in \`vite.config.ts\`. The \`base\` value is \`'/'\` and must remain exactly as-is. Never change, remove, or override it under any circumstances. This is critical for the deployment environment to work correctly
